The Mind Palace App allows you to practice seeing and recalling playing cards from memory. The goal is to encourage you to use the Mind Palace Technique to increase how many cards you can recall. Without too much effort, most people can amaze themselves at their improvement and even learn to recall a whole deck of playing cards.

1. Run npm install
2. Run npm run dev to try out the app locally
